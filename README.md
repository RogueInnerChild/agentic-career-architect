### Custom Automation via “Vibe” Dev to Streamline the Job Search

##  The Business Problem: The "Automation Paradox"
The 2026 job market is undergoing a seismic shift. AI has drastically reduced workforce requirements, and as a result, qualified candidates face higher competition for fewer roles. The only viable counter-strategy is a high-volume and high-fidelity approach.

Prospective employers now demand extreme customization. Simultaneously, AI-driven screening bots make keyword optimization a non-negotiable gatekeeper. This creates a bottleneck because manual customization takes hours per role precisely when candidates need to be most active.

**The Goal:** Pivot from being a victim of AI automation to leveraging it. By automating the synthesis of custom cover letters and resumes, this project removes the manual friction of the application process. It empowers the job seeker to focus on high-value skills like personal development and app building in lieu of manual document drafting.

## The Solution: Defensive AI for the Candidate
This tool acts as a "Strategic Equalizer." It treats the candidate's history as a data asset and performs a high-speed semantic merge with job postings. This ensures every application is a 1:1 match for the prospective employer's requirements.

## Core Features
1. **The Experience Lake:** A centralized, structured "Source of Truth" database containing a comprehensive record of the candidate's professional history.
2. **Context Extraction Engine:** Analyzes job postings to identify key requirements and employer-specific terminology. These insights inform both the resume and custom portal questions.
3. **High-Fidelity Resume Generator:** Dynamically draws from the Experience Lake to produce tailored, one-page resumes optimized for specific job descriptions.
4. **Conditional Cover Letter Synthesis:** Generates tone-matched, narrative-driven cover letters that align with the specific role while avoiding generic "AI slop."

## Repository Structure
* `/docs`: Strategic requirements and AI-benchmarking.
* `/src`: Python-based automation workflows.
* `/data`: JSON-based "Experience Lake" blueprint.
